                <strong>nanoscope</strong> is a javascript library designed to make complex transformations of data much easier.
                It is a built on the idea of a functional <strong>Lens</strong> -- a construct that enables focusing on sub-parts
                of data structures to get and modify. <strong>nanoscope</strong> is a collection of these so-called <strong>Lenses</strong> boxed
                up into a convenient package with a simple, intuitive interface.

                Suppose we have a simple representation of a game of Pac-Man in front of us that someone built
                using raw dynamic objects. We have some garbage to locate and get rid of, and perhaps
                we want to modify the game in some way.
            </p>

            <div style="height: 19em"></div>

            <p class="describe">First, we construct a lens that looks into our game object.</p>

            <div style="height: 0.1em"></div>

            <p class="describe">
                We can use <code>path</code> to look into a nested object, and <code>set</code>
                to modify it. <code>set</code> returns a modified game, so we set it here. Notice that we're setting
                a property that you might expect to throw an error -- with nanoscope, modification proceeds safely, and
                our player's first name is set to 'Pac-Man'
            </p>

            <p class="describe">
                Here, we focus on the location of the first enemy in the enemies table, and pull out its <code>x</code>
                coordinate. <code>following</code> is an alias for <code>path</code>; <code>nanoscope</code> has many
                aliases like these so you can use it how you want.
            </p>

            <p class="describe">
                We can use <code>plucking</code> to focus on on specific properties of an object and transform them.
                This increments the player's <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> coordinates and returns a new game object.
            </p>

            <p class="describe">
                There are many more functions we can use to further prune data. Here, we find Clyde and extract his traits --
                well, all of the traits that consist only of letters -- using <code>filter</code>. If Clyde
                didn't exist in the enemies list, <code>nanoscope</code> wouldn't care;
                this would just return <code>[]</code> instead of failing catastrophically.
